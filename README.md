# IPS4-Converters
A fork of the official IPS4-Converters that fixes issues in PHPBB migration

The official IPS4 conversion package is available here: https://invisionpower.com/files/file/7814-ips4-converters/

This fork addresses some issues experienced during our own forum migration, at http://forum.mtasa.com previously running phpBB 3.0.14.
